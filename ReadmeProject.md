This script helps user to create a README file from terminal inputs. To start the program, user types node index.js in the terminal. It asks me questions. I enter my project title, then answer questions about description, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, questions. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88174852/137667813-c7c173c6-5e8e-4b08-a617-c041d009a652.png)

When I finish my inputs, I upload my README file to github. Title that I entered is displayed as title. Inputs that I entered are added to description, installation instructions, Usage Information, Contributing, Tests. License badge is added to the top of my page.
