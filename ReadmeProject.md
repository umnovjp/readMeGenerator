This script helps user to create a README file from terminal inputs. To start the program, user types node index.js in the terminal. It asks me questions. I enter my project title, then answer questions about description, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, questions.

Inputs that I entered are added to description, installation instructions, Usage Information, Contributing, Tests. License badge is added to the top of my page. Notice is added to the license section.
