# readMeGenerator
This script helps user to create a README file from terminal inputs. To start the program, user types node index.js in the terminal. It asks me questions. I enter my project title, then answer questions about description, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, questions.

When I finish my inputs, I upload my README file to github. Title that I entered is displayed as title. Inputs that I entered are added to description, installation instructions, Usage Information, Contributing, Tests. License badge is added to the top of my page. Notice is added to the license section.

My email and github links are added to Questions section. User can click those links to send me an email or visit my github page. And when I click Contents links, I am taken to appropriate section

And cool part is that I added a couple of cliparts to make README file less boring. It was not easy.
